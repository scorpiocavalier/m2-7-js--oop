# JS: Object Oriented Programming

Your job in this workshop will be to write two sets of programs, to catalog data in an Object Oriented style. First with cats, then with books.

We recognize that this is a difficult assignment given how fresh the concepts are! To make life a bit easier, we've provided some samples of OOP code. Check out the "samples" directory if you're feeling confused / not sure where to start.
